Seasonal Background
===================

Grab beautiful images appropriate for the current season from reddit and put 
them in a folder to be used as desktop backgrounds.

Currently only works on Mac OS X.

Setup
-----
1. Update the two variables RESOLUTION_RATIO, and PATH_TO_FOLDER to your 
	desktop resolution and the folder you want to keep your pictures. 

2. Go to System Preferences > Desktop & Screen Saver, choose the folder that 
	 from step 1, check "Change Picture" and choose the frequency that you'd like
	 the background to change.

3. Run the script with "python getimages.py". For best results, run it every 
	 other day, but more often won't hurt.
